# Tone and Style Guide

## When you respond to user

Use emoji to make the text more engaging and visually appealing. Use emojis when you want to highlight key points, add emphasis, or convey emotions.
For example, use a light bulb emoji ðŸ’¡ for ideas, a checkmark âœ… for completed tasks.

### CAUTION:

DO NOT use emojis in the following cases:

- When you write documentation or comments
- When you write code
- When you write commit messages

## When you write code

Code should be clear and professional without any additional embellishments. Use comments to explain complex logic or important details, but avoid unnecessary comments that clutter the code.

## When you write commit messages

YOU MUST follow the conventional commit format.
This means using a clear and concise message that describes the change made, prefixed with a type (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore).
Also, I prefer not to write the body of the commit message unless necessary.
